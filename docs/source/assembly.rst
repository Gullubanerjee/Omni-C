Kmer analysis, QV and completness
---------------------------------

In preparation 

In this section we will not use the long distance infomation that is captured by the Omni-C proximity ligation libraries. Instead, we take advandage of the uniform coverafe of Omni-C libraries and demonstrate how, after trimming, the reads can be used just as shotgun sequencing, for kmer analysis, measuring assembly completness and QV
