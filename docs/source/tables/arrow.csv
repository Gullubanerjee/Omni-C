Parameter,Function
\-Xmx16000m,"The flag Xmx specifies the maximum memory allocation pool for a Java virtual machine\, from our experience 16000m works well when processing human data sets\, you can increase the allocated memory if needed."
Djava.awt.headless=true,"Java is ran in a headless mode when the application does not interact with a user (if not specified\, the default is Djava.awt.headless=false)"
arrowhead,The arrowhead command is used to identify contact domains along the diagonal
\--threads,Specifies the numbers of threads to be used (integer number)
\-k,"Normalization to be used. KR (Knight-Ruiz) balancing is recommended (other avilable normalization methods are VC and VC_SQRT or NONE,  this is not recommended)  "
\-m,Size of the sliding window along the diagonal in which contact domains will be found. Must be an even number as (m/2) is used as the increment for the sliding window. Recommended value: 2000 (this is also the default) 
\-r,"Resolution for which Arrowhead will be run. We recommend running with various resolutions,  e.g.: 5kB (5000),  10kB (10000),  25kb (25000) and 50kb (50000). The quality of the results at the various resolutions is highly dependent on the depth of sequencing "
\*.hic,"hic input file\, containing the contact matrix"
\*.bedpe,"bedpe file containing the contact domains,  this is a text file with 12 fields in each row. For more details on the file format,  see the :ref:`table<TFORMAT>` below"
