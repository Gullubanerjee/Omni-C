==========


At step :ref:`Removig PCR duplicates<DUPs>` you used the flag ``--output-stats``, generating a stats file in addition to the pairsam output (e.g. --output-stats stats.txt). The stats file is an extensive output of pairs statistics as calculated by pairtools, including total reads, total mapped, total dups, total pairs for each pair of chromosomes etc'. Although you can use directly the pairtools stats file as is to get informed on the quality of the Omni-C library, we find it easier to focus on a few key metrics. We include in this repository the script ``get_qc.py`` that summarize the paired-tools stats file and present them in percentage values in addition to absolute values.

The images below explains how the values on the QC report are calculated:

.. image:: /images/QC_cis_trans_valids.png

**Command:**

.. code-block:: console

   python3 ./Omni-C/get_qc.py -p <stats.txt>


**Example:**

.. code-block:: console

   python3 ./Omni-C/get_qc.py -p stats.txt 


After the script completes, it will print:

.. code-block:: console
